        This is the Home page. This site has its subject matter set to talk about the javascript-based front-end library called React. There are some links and other useful resources to show you how to employ the setup and use some of its capabilities. The site is always under construction, so random things may appear and disappear from time to time, with no exact date of start or termination.
